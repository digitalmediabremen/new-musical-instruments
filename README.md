# New Musical Instruments

this is a currated collection of instruments that are *new* for some reason.

> Otamatone is an instrument in the shape of a note. Play it by pressing the stem switch!

- COMMENT: "otamatone is one of the most iconic muscial instruments of the last decades. the interaction is very simple and lends itself to traditional instruments. the shape is very *pop* and comic, however the combination of electronic sound generation and *analog* filtering is quite smart yet simple. it is impressive to see how this *funny* contribution became a widespread mass product."

## Teenage Engineering: Pocket Operator

> "a wall of sound in your pocket. pocket operators are small, ultra portable music devices,
with studio quality sound and the flexibility to make music on the go. affordable for everyone and compatible with all other music gear."

- COMMENT: "the Pocket Operator (PO) series is a series of pocket calculator style musical instruments. while the principal and the interaction design is not extremly novel ( basically a 16-step sequencer ) the individual and indosyncratic implementations are profoundly impressive ( the screen design alone is well worth noticing ). POs are quite easy not get started with but often offer quite some depth to explore. the units can also be synced with each other or with other systems via a repurposed audio signal ( e.g to an modular setup )."
